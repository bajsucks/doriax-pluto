Doriax is a free, open-source game engine with a small, data-oriented C++ runtime and a desktop editor for building 2D, 3D, and UI scenes. You can script in Lua, in C++, or mix the two. Your game can be exported as a standalone CMake project that includes the engine source, so you can build it yourself for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, or the web, and change anything you like.

## Example games

Click a screenshot to play the game in your browser. Each one is a regular Doriax project, so you can also clone it and open it in the editor.

## Exporting your game

**Source Code** export writes a standalone CMake project. Your scenes become generated C++ that calls the public engine API, your C++ scripts are compiled alongside them unchanged, and Lua scripts and assets are kept as runtime resources. The project also contains the platform backends, compiled shaders, and the engine source it needs, so you can open it, change anything (the engine included), and build it with the usual native toolchains, without the editor.

If you just want something to run, **Desktop** export builds a native executable for your computer, and **Web** export builds HTML and WebAssembly with Emscripten. The [export guide](https://docs.doriax.org/editor/export/#from-editor-data-to-runtime-code) explains what gets generated.

## Platforms

| Area | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| Export targets | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, HTML5 |
| Graphics APIs | OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D 11 |

Which graphics APIs are available depends on the target platform.

## Getting started

Download the editor from the [website](https://doriax.org/#download) or the [releases page](https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax/releases), then follow [Your First Project](https://docs.doriax.org/getting-started/first-project/) to create a scene, attach a script, and run it.

Use a tagged release for real projects. Builds from `main` have the newest changes, but they can also have regressions, unfinished work, or breaking changes.

The editor also runs from the command line to export projects and generate shaders, for example in CI. See [Command-Line Tools](https://docs.doriax.org/editor/command-line/).

## Building from source

You need a C++17 compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang), CMake 3.27 or newer (the bundled shader compiler requires it), and Python 3. Clone the repository, then follow the steps for your platform:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax.git
cd doriax
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux (Ubuntu 26.04)</strong></summary>

Ubuntu 26.04 ships a recent enough CMake, so the official repositories are all you need:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  build-essential cmake git ninja-build pkg-config python3 \
  libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols \
  libdbus-1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target doriax-editor
./build/doriax-editor
```

To create a redistributable install tree under `dist/`:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix dist
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake, and Ninja:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target doriax-editor
open build/Doriax.app
```

To create a redistributable app under `dist/bin/`:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix dist
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows (Visual Studio)</strong></summary>

Install Python 3 and Visual Studio 2022 or newer with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and the **C++ CMake tools for Windows** component. Then, from a Developer PowerShell or Developer Command Prompt:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release --target doriax-editor doriax-editor-cmd
build\Release\doriax-editor.exe
```

For Visual Studio 2026, use the `"Visual Studio 18 2026"` generator. `doriax-editor-cmd` is the console version of the editor, used for command-line work. It is not part of the default build, which is why it is listed explicitly.

To install the editor, the console executable, the runtime library, and the engine files under `dist/bin/`:

```powershell
cmake --install build --prefix dist --config Release
```

To play C++ scripts inside the editor, they have to be built with a toolchain compatible with the editor itself: for the official download, that means MSVC with the same architecture. Lua-only projects play without a C++ compiler, but exporting still needs build tools. See [Building for Windows](https://docs.doriax.org/building/windows/) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64)</strong></summary>

Only needed if you want to build C++ scripts with GCC. The official download is built with MSVC, and MSVC and UCRT64 GCC binaries can't be mixed, so the editor, the engine, and your scripts all have to come from the same UCRT64 toolchain. There is no UCRT64 release package.

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and update it with `pacman -Syu` (reopen the terminal and repeat if it asks). Then, in the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal, from the repository directory:

```bash
pacman -S --needed git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python

cmake -S . -B build-ucrt64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build-ucrt64 --target doriax-editor doriax-editor-cmd
./build-ucrt64/doriax-editor.exe
```

Start the editor from that terminal so it finds the compiler, `mingw32-make`, and the runtime DLLs, and select the UCRT64 GCC kit in **Project Settings > Build**. If an older project keeps its previous compiler setup, close the editor and delete only the project's `.doriax/build` folder.

This path is newer and less tested than the MSVC build. If C++ scripts fail to compile or load in Play, please open an issue.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vulkan editor (optional)</strong></summary>

The editor uses OpenGL on Windows and Linux and Metal on macOS. To build it with Vulkan on Windows or Linux, install the Vulkan SDK and add `-DGRAPHIC_BACKEND=vulkan` to the configure command. A separate build directory lets you keep both backends:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DGRAPHIC_BACKEND=vulkan
cmake --build build-vulkan --target doriax-editor
```

On Windows, add the same flag to the Visual Studio configure command instead.

## Project history and development

Doriax started in 2015 as Supernova Engine, a code-only game engine. Public development began with the [first commit in July 2016](https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax/commit/88561113), and the full history is in this repository. Building complete games with code alone turned out to be impractical, so in 2024 I started a visual editor in a [separate repository](https://github.com/eduardodoria/doriax-editor), then called `supernova-editor`.

Version 0.5.5 was the last release under the Supernova name, and 0.6 the first as Doriax. Some internal folders and older links still use the Supernova name while the transition finishes.

About the use of AI: the architecture, technical direction, and engineering decisions are mine. Over the past year I have used AI coding tools for well-defined tasks such as repetitive implementation, investigation, documentation, and review, and I review and adapt what they produce. This is separate from the AI assistant inside the editor, which is an optional feature you choose to turn on.
